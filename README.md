CUDLR
=====

CUDLR (**C**onsole for **U**nity **D**ebugging and **L**ogging **R**emotely) is a remote developer console for Unity. Instead of struggling to enter console commands on a mobile devices or having to constantly export debugging logs from a device, CUDLR lets you use your development machine to enter debug commands and see their output or any log messages or stack traces. 

To do this, CUDLR starts a webserver on the target device to host static files and exposes a HTTP API for executing commands which can interface with your project. 

We wrote CUDLR to use in [Proletariat's](http://www.proletariat.com) upcoming game, [World Zombination](http://www.worldzombination.com). For more info on why we wrote it and other tools we've released, check out our [blog](http://blog.proletariat.com).

### Features
* Supports iOS, Android, PC/Mac Standalone, and the Unity Editor
* Capture Unity log messages and stack traces
* Console runs in any browser
* Copy/paste from/to the console
* Tab completion
* Command history
* Standard text-entry shortcuts (ctrl-a, ctrl-e, etc)
* Uses standard HTML/CSS for layout
* Supports displaying of context specific colored messages
 
How do I use CUDLR?
----
* Download the unitypackage from github or the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/12294) and import it in to your project.
* Create an empty GameObject in the scene and add the CUDLR->Server component.
* To use message coloring, on the empty GameObject containing the Server script, update the "Message Colors" array to 
  define the colors used by your game's logging. Both Name and Color for each element should be defined, and Name
  should be unique for each color.
* Set the port on the component (default value is 55055).
* Add the CUDLR.Command attribute to your code.
* Run the game and connect to http://localhost:55055 with your browser.

An example CUDLR Server GameObject prefab is located in Assets/CUDLR/Examples. Add the GameObject to the scene,
run the game, and connect to the console with your browser.

An example of adding commands is available [here](https://github.com/proletariatgames/CUDLR/blob/master/CUDLR/Examples/GameObjectExamples.cs).

Adding Additional Commands
----

Add a ConsoleCommand attribute to any static method. When the Command String is entered into the console the
Delegate will be called passing in any additional arguments used in the console.

```
[CUDLR.Command(<Command String>, <Description>, <Optional: flag to run on main thread>)]
```

The CUDLR.Command Callback Delegate returns void and either takes void or a string[] of arguments.

```
public delegate void Callback(string[] args);
public delegate void CallbackSimple();
```


Delegate functions can output data to the console by calling the CUDLR Console Log function or using Unity's built-in logging.

```
CUDLR.Console.Log( <Log String> );
```

To use message coloring defined on the GameObject containing the Server script, use the alternate CUDLR Console Log function, specifying the color Name (as specified on the Server GameObject) as the second parameter:

```
CUDLR.Console.Log( <Log String> , <color name as defined on the Server GameObject> );
```
Adding Additional Routes
----

Add a CUDLR Route attribute to any static method. When the route regex is matched, the
Delegate will be called passing in the http context and optionally the regex result.

```
[CUDLR.Route(<Route Pattern>, <Optional: Method Pattern>)]
```
